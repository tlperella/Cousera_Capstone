The data will be scraped from the website, cleansed for use in the analysis and categorized by beach area determined by latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\nThe Foursquare API will be used to extract the venues for each of the beach areas. The data will be categorized by venue type (i.e, family restaurant, bar, park, amusement area, etc) to determine which beach area seems to cater to which types of travelers.\n"
